# Simple Todo App

A simple to-do application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them when no longer needed. This project focuses on refactoring existing JavaScript code using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

- Users can add new to-dos using a popup form.

- Form validation ensures that input data meets requirements before submission.

- Each to-do item can be marked as completed or deleted.

- A unique ID is generated for each to-do using the uuid package.

- The project is structured using JavaScript modules to maintain clean, reusable code.

## Technology
